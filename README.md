# NextJS Database Auth Starter

A simple starer to use authentication with a database for NextJS. Written with MongoDB to start, and ideally other database adapters in the future.

## TODO:

⏹ Move auth functions to a different folder where they are not public
⏹ Refactor setting cookies into own file
⏹ Illustrate the login and registration flow somehow

✅ Add cookies to user after registering, then redirect to home page
